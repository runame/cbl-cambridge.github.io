Gido van de Ven joined the group in 2018 as visiting researcher. He received his PhD from the University of Oxford working with David Dupret, after which he started a postdoc with Andreas Tolias at the Baylor College of Medicine. He integrates insights or concepts from Neuroscience into deep learning models, with as goal (1) to make their performance more human-like and (2) to gain deeper insights in the computational roles of empirical properties of the brain. He has a particular interest in the role of reactivation in memory consolidation.
