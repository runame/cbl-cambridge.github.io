I am a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) within the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Richard Turner](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/ret26) and advised by [Carl Edward Rasmussen](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/).
I am broadly interested in better understanding and improving deep learning.
Specifically, I work on **approximate Bayesian inference** and **training algorithms** for **deep learning**.

Previously, I obtained an MSc in Machine Learning from the University of Tübingen and worked as a research assistant in the [Methods of Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/start/) group led by [Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens/personen/philipp-hennig/).
I received a BSc in Cognitive Science from the University of Osnabrück and spent my final year as an intern in the [Approximate Bayesian Inference Team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io/) led by [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) at RIKEN AIP in Tokyo.
