I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group supervised by Professor Richard E. Turner and David S. Krueger, starting in January 2023. I am also part of the Cambridge-Tübingen PhD Fellowship in Machine Learning program. I received my BA and MEng in Information and Computer Engineering from the Cambridge University Engineering Department in 2020. 

My interests are broadly at the intersection of probabilistic modelling, deep learning and structure learning. I'm particularly interested in how deep learning can learn and represent in our models the structure present in the data — questions pertinent to interpretability (what has the model discovered about the data generating process?) and robustness (how can the model learn to generalise to novel inputs in a structured way, e.g. by learning invariances and equivariances?).
