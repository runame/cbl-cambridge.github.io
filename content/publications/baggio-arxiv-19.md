In both natural and engineered systems, communication often occurs dynamically
over networks ranging from highly structured grids to largely disordered
graphs. To use, or comprehend the use of, networks as efficient communication
media requires understanding of how they propagate and transform information in
the face of noise. Here, we develop an information-theoretic framework that
enables us to examine how network structure, noise, input coding, and
interference between consecutive symbols jointly determine transmission
performance in networks with linear dynamics at single nodes and arbitrary
topologies. Mathematically normal networks, which can be decomposed into
separate low-dimensional information channels, suffer greatly from readout
noise. Interestingly, most details of their wiring have no impact on
transmission quality. Non-normal networks, however, can largely cancel the
effect of noise by transiently amplifying select input dimensions while
ignoring others, resulting in higher net information throughput. Our theory
could inform the design of new communication networks, as well as the optimal
use of existing ones.
