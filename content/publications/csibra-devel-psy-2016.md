<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

Looking times (LTs) are frequently measured in empirical research on infant
cognition. We analyzed the statistical distribution of LTs across participants
to develop recommendations for their treatment in infancy research. Our
analyses focused on a common within-subject experimental design, in which
longer looking to novel or unexpected stimuli is predicted. We analyzed data
from 2 sources: an in-house set of LTs that included data from individual
participants (47 experiments, 1,584 observations), and a representative set of
published articles reporting group-level LT statistics (149 experiments from 33
articles). We established that LTs are log-normally distributed across
participants, and therefore, should always be log-transformed before parametric
statistical analyses. We estimated the typical size of significant effects in
LT studies, which allowed us to make recommendations about setting sample
sizes. We show how our estimate of the distribution of effect sizes of LT
studies can be used to design experiments to be analyzed by Bayesian
statistics, where the experimenter is required to determine in advance the
predicted effect size rather than the sample size. We demonstrate the
robustness of this method in both sets of LT experiments.
