Reliable information processing is a hallmark of many physical and biological
networked systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for modelling
information transmission within a linear dynamical network. Information
propagation is modelled by means of a digital communication protocol that takes
into account the realistic phenomenon of inter-symbol interference. Building on
this framework, we adopt the Shannon information rate to quantify the amount of
information that can be reliably sent over the network within a fixed time
window. We investigate how the latter information metric is affected by the
connectivity structure of the network.  Here, we focus in particular on
networks characterized by a normal adjacency matrix. We show that for such
networks the maximum achievable information rate depends only on the spectrum
of the adjacency matrix. We then provide numerical results suggesting that
non-normal network architectures could benefit information transmission in our
framework.
