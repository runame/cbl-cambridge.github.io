In both natural and engineered systems, communication often occurs dynamically
over networks ranging from highly structured grids to largely disordered
graphs. To use, or comprehend the use of, networks as efficient communication
media requires understanding of how they propagate and transform information in
the face of noise. Here, we develop a framework that enables us to examine how
network structure, noise, and interference between consecutive packets jointly
determine transmission performance in complex networks governed by linear
dynamics. Mathematically, normal networks, which can be decomposed into
separate low-dimensional information channels, suffer greatly from readout
noise. Most details of their wiring have no impact on transmission quality.
Non-normal networks, however, can largely cancel the effect of noise by
transiently amplifying select input dimensions while ignoring others, resulting
in higher net information throughput. Our theory could inform the design of new
communication networks, as well as the optimal use of existing ones.
